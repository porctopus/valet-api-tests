The data is not an official statistical release by the Bank of Canada, and it is provided on a voluntary basis by the author(s). The Bank and the author(s) are not responsible for errors in this file and do not guarantee that the series will be updated in the future. A contact person is listed below for any question or other inquiry.\nNote from the author(s):\nThe BOS underlying indicator is re-estimated every quarter following the release of the Business Outlook Survey (results are available on the Bank website). As such, the entire time series is revised after every release.  The date field refers to the first day of the quarter where the BOS underlying indicator is estimated. For example, 01/04/2016 refers to the 2016Q2 estimate, which is available roughly one week after the end of the quarter (e.g. mid-July 2016).\nContact person:\nLise Pichette (lpichette@bank-banque-canada.ca)"
